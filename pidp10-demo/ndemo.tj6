1WHAT WAS THE AI LAB?0


4OSCAR:0 The MIT AI Lab has a unique place in history, for the culture it
created (earliest hackers), and the impact that had (major innovations
at the time, but importantly, also a lasting impact in terms of Open
Source culture) and the reason this happened (MIT/DARPA/DEC).

4OSCAR:0 Referring to Levy's "Hackers" book, this project takes
another angle.  Not preserving the human-interest stories, or the dry
factuals, but to preserve what was actually there.  By reconstructing
a fully functional version of the AI Lab.
